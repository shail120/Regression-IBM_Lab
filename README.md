Practice Regression

we learn how to use scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value. 

we learn how to use scikit-learn library to implement Multiple linear regression. We again use the Carbon dioxide emission dataset to build a model, Evaluate the model, and finally use model to predict unknown value. 

 learn about Polynomial regressions and apply an example on python. You learn how to transfer your feature sets, and then use Multiple Linear Regression, to solve such a problem.
 
 If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear. 
learn about non linear regressions and apply an example on python. In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the data points corresponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.

 we learn Logistic Regression, and then, you'll create a model with telecommunications data to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that you can take some action to retain the customer.
